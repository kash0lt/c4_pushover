# c4_pushover
## What does c4push over do?
### General Description
c4pushover is a python script that utilizes internet websites to do some work
as well as a *Control4* project in the target home.
Once the ground work connections are made, c4pushover makes
use of strings sent from the app, to a web site.
The web then determines the app target, user and app token key
to send the message to the target.
The target receives these *push* notifications, evaluates them,
and then acts upon the messages.
